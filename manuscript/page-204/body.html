    <p>Ladakh is usually described as a high-altitude desert but it is much more than just that. It is a land of high passes, lakes the color of turquoise, isolated monasteries, ancient rituals and, of course, a fantastic cold desert of monumental beauty.
        It is situated at the crossroads of High Asia with the Great Himalayas to its south and the eastern Karakorum mountains to its north. It is separated from Kashmir by the Zanskar range and from China by the Pangong range. Within these terrific
        boundaries is a landscape that will leave a person breathless. Sometimes, literally.</p>

    <p>In summer, when the rest of India is swept by the monsoon, snow on the high passes of Ladakh melts allowing access to the ‘Kingdom in the Sky’. The moisture laden monsoon clouds are blocked by the Himalayas and the open passes allow access to various
        remote areas.</p>

    <p>This book is a collection of photographs I made during my travels to Ladakh from 2008 to 2014. I hope you will enjoy the photos and, perhaps, make a trip of your own to this fantastic region.</p>
