    <p> My first trip to Ladakh was in 2008. Enchanted by this very fantastical trans-Himalayan region of India, by its untouched beauty and culture, its enormity of mountains and rivulets, my love for the place has only grown over the years.</p>
    <p> Strange as it may seem I can't get out of this affair anymore. </p>
    <p> I plan to visit again. </p>
