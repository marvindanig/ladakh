## Introduction

This is an article on how I wrote a [photo book about Ladakh](https://bubblin.io/book/ladakh-by-satie-sharma/1) on [bubblin](https://www.bubblin.io).

Bubblin provides two methods for writing books -
* a simple [online web editor](https://bubblin.io/docs/tutorial) for writing simple short books
* a powerful desktop book writing tool called [bookiza](https://bookiza.io)

I chose `bookiza` to write my book as it provides more control over the writing process.

## Setup

To setup the book writing environment with `bookiza`, the following tools are required. I am a Mac user so the instructions below are for macOS.

##### NodeJS 
Install with [homebrew](https://brew.sh)

```console
$ brew install node
```

##### git 
If you have Xcode command line tools installed, then you already have git. Otherwise, you can install git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

##### bookiza

```console
$ npm -i g bookiza
$ bookiza --version
0.0.50
```

[Sign up](https://bubblin.io/users/new) for an account on bubblin and register bookiza.

```console
$ bookiza register
username: satie
password: *****************

Registration successful.
```

## Layout

The content of my book consists mainly of photographs. There is very little text. As such, a simple layout template was selected for the book.

```console
$ bookiza new ladakh --leafs 50 --template magazine
```
This created a book with 100 pages (each leaf is 2 pages) with the following directory structure

![directory structure](dir_struct.png)

#### Template

The `templates` directory contains `html`, `javascript` and `css` that gets applied to all the pages in the book. In this case, the files in this directory are empty to begin with. 

The [EB Garamond](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/EB+Garamond) font was selected to be applied across the book and imported in the `style.css`. Common style elements to be applied to the body of all html pages were defined in this file as well.

```css
@import url('//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=EB+Garamond:400,400i');
html,
body {
    background: #fff;
    margin: 0 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    color: #666;
    font: 4.4vw/1.20 'EB Garamond', serif;
    height: 100vh;
    width: 100vw;
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-size: 100% 100%;
}
```

#### Covers

The `manuscript` directory contains directories for individual pages of the book. `page-1` is the front cover and `page-100` is the back cover. Similarly, front inside cover is `page-2` and back inside cover is `page-99`.

Within the `page-1` directory is are `html` and `css` files for the content and style for the cover. `body.html` contains the title and subtitle for the book

```html
<div class="face">
    <div class="top flex">
        <div>
            <h1 class="title"> ladakh </h1>
            <h2 class="subtitle"> A Journey to Little Tibet </h2>
            <hr/>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="bottom flex ">
        <div> Â© Satie Sharma </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

`style.css` contains the CSS applied to `page-1` in addition to the CSS defined in the `template` above

```css
html,
body {
    height: 100vh;
    width: 100vw;
    margin: 0;
}

.face:before {
    content: "";
    position: fixed;
    left: 0;
    right: 0;
    z-index: -1;
    background-image: url(https://res.cloudinary.com/satie/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto/v1517241523/nature/PangongSunset01);
    background-position: center center;
    height: 100vh;
    width: 100vw;
    background-size: 100% 100%;
    -webkit-filter: blur(0px);
    -moz-filter: blur(0px);
    -o-filter: blur(0px);
    -ms-filter: blur(5px);
    filter: blur(0px);
    -moz-transition: all 300ms;
    -o-transition: all 300ms;
    -webkit-transition: all 300ms;
    transition: all 300ms;
}
.
.
.
```

The front and back covers use fullbleed background images that span the entire page with the title and subtitle overlayed on top of it.

![cover](cover.png)

The front inside cover is another image though not fullbleed but justified with the some space all around. As this is a design that is used in multiple pages, CSS for `page-2` is defined in the template. `page-3` is just a simple text title. 

```css
.leaf {
    height: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    width: 80%;
    margin: auto;
}

.inner {
    width: 100%;
}

.flex {
    display: -webkit-box;
    display: flex !important;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
}

.justify {
    text-align: justify;
}
```

`body.html` for `page-2` just has a `div` element to display the image

```html
<div class="leaf flex">
    <div class="inner justify ">
        <img class="overlay" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/satie/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,q_auto/spiritual/PadmasambhavaPainting_Hemis01 " width="100%" />
    </div>
</div>
```

#### Page layout

The layout was designed to look similar to a coffee table book with some pages with just a single photo and others with multiple. 

![mixed layout](mixedimagelayout.png)

Some photos are fullbleed taking up two middle pages like a center spread.

* bookiza server

## Issues

* bookiza performance with large number of pages
* image load performance (move to cloudinary)

## Conclusion

* improvements
